# ExplodingViewDiagram
A small Unity project that demonstrates a workflow to create an exploding view diagram with labels. The video below explains the project from the animation needed, importing and how the scripts hook up to buttons and mouse-clicks to make things happen. I include two camera orbit scripts, toggle them on/off to see the difference. Feel free to use this as a stub for your own project!

[Tutorials by Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials)

There are a lot of tutorials, if you are brand new to Unity, I'm going to suggest these from the Topics section to get you started:
[Interface and Essentials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/interface-essentials)
The [Animator Component](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/animation/animator-component?playlist=17099) and [Animation Layers](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/animation/animator-controller-layers?playlist=17099) explain more about the Animator. To customize the [UI](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/user-interface-ui) you will need to focus on the [UI Canvas](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/user-interface-ui/ui-canvas?playlist=17111) and the [UI Rect Transform](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/ui/rect-transform?playlist=17111).

My project includes [Post-Processing Effects](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.2/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessing-Stack.html). These are under active development, so it's kind of hard to find them and instructions. I used the [Package Manager](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/05/04/project-management-is-evolving-unity-package-manager-overview/) to load the package from Unity>WIndows>Package Manager. You can probably use that to check if this version is current.

This tutorial is geared for artist/designers. The [Artist Tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/unity-artists) go into more detail about how to further improve the final look of the application.
